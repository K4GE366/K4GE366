  <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm JM</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a Grade 11 STEM student passionate about Computer Science and creativity. I love building thingsâ€”from fun games and websites to meaningful digital projects that show my growth and ideas.

  <p>
    Right now, I'm exploring HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, and working on interactive projects like a dreamy starry night animation, 12 dimesion in HTML/WEB, flowers and a heartfelt birthday surprise site.

    Every click, bug, and breakthrough is part of my journey. Thanks for stopping byâ€”check out my projects below!
